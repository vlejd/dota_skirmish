# Dota 2 Skirmish

Recreate any situation inside Dota 2 lobby. 
 - Play only 5 min late game teamfight instead of a full 40 min game.
 - Improve at high level objectives: rosh fights, highground pushing, team fights, base racing,
 - Find the best strategy for any situation.
 - Train the same moment until perfection.

It is a Dota 2 Mod (arcade game, custom game) for reproducing interesting in-game scenarios. Pretty much an attempt to reimplement replay takeover.
Game state is receovered using this fork of [redota](https://github.com/timkurvers/redota): [https://github.com/vlejd/redota](https://github.com/vlejd/redota)
